This RACOS algorithm was implemented in python

In this package, there are files as follows:
Components.py
ObjectiveFunction.py
Racos.py
Run_Racos.py
Tools.py

The necessary files for RACOS are Components.py, Racos.py and Tools.py. The RACOS algorithm was implemented in Racos.py. There are some test functions in ObjectiveFunction.py, you can implement other tasks in other file. In Run_Racos.py, There are some demos of calling RACOS.
