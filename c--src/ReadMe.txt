This RACOS algorithm was implemented in C++

In this package, there are files as follows:
Components.h
ObjectiveFunction.h
RacosOptimization.h
stdafx.h
targetver.h
Tools.h
Racos.cpp
stdafx.cpp

The necessary files for RACOS are Components.h, RacosOptimization.h and Tools.h. The RACOS algorithm was implemented in RacosOptimization.h. There are some test functions in ObjectiveFucntion.h, you can implement other tasks in other file. In Racos.cpp, there are some demos of calling RACOS. If you want to run Racos.cpp, please include stdafx.h.
